### mu-plugins/ 
- In this directory there is a _must-use-plugin_ titled Starter Theme Functionality. This plugin contains useful functions that are project-related rather than theme-related.
- _Must Use Plugins_ are executed (ie. activated automatically) before any other plugins, and cannot be disabled by the user. This is a great way to store important functionality for a WordPress project, and ensure it won't be accidentally deactivated or removed. 
- Functions in the plugin: removal of the default link to attachment file on images, removal of the `<p>` tag around images, setup of custom editor styles, customization of the excerpt
